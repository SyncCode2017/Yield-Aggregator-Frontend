This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Both yield-aggregator-hh and this repo have to be cloned to run the project locally.

After cloning the two repos, open a terminal and run

```bash
cd Yield-Aggregator-Frontend
yarn
```
to install all the dependencies.

Start the development server by running

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the user interface.

Open another terminal change the directory to yield-aggregator-hh folder. 

```bash
cd Yield-Aggregator-Frontend
```

Then run

```bash
yarn
```

To start harhat local-host (blockchain), run

```bash
yarn hardhat node
```

At this point, the local-host should be running and you can start interacting with the user interface.
